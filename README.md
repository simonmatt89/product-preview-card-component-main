## Overview

This is my first project with Front End Mentor. I'm happy with the result alhtough I have really struggled to complete the mobile-design aspect of this project.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

I have learnt to place a main container in the cetre of the page and include to child dontainers which were placed side to side. I was happy with my use of felxbox when the dimensions of the browser changed.

### Continued development

I really tried to create the mobile-design but after 2-3 hours of searching the web for many soltuions, none of them worked. I think I may create a html/ css file for practise use where I could further explore this and use a template for future projects.
